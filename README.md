R-basic-stats
==============

Notes for basic statistics notions, with a bioinformatics/biomedical
bent. We cover comparing two groups and a little bit of linear models. The
notes assume some familiarity with R. These notes focus on some basic
statistical concepts with R, whereas those in
[R-bioinfo-intro](https://github.com/rdiaz02/R-bioinfo-intro) focus on
programming and using R, without emphasis in statistics. 



These notes are very similar to those in the
[BM-1](https://github.com/rdiaz02/BM-1), but those notes use (R
Commander)[http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr] whereas these notes
do not (the intended audience is different).
