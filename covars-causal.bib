                   growing exponentially in fields that deal with
                   observational data. Written by pioneers in the field,
                   this practical book presents an authoritative yet
                   accessible overview of the methods and applications
                   of causal inference. With a wide range of detailed,
                   worked examples using real epidemiologic data as well
                   as software for replicating the analyses, the text

                   dictum metastasized in the twentieth century into one
                   of science's biggest obstacles, as a legion of
                   researchers became unwilling to make the claim that
                   one thing could cause another. Even two decades ago,
                   asking a statistician a question like "Was it the
                   aspirin that stopped my headache?" would have been
                   like asking if he believed in voodoo, or at best a
                   topic for conversation at a cocktail party rather
                   than a legitimate target of scientific inquiry.
                   Scientists were allowed to posit only that the
                   probability that one thing was associated with
                   another. This all changed with Judea Pearl, whose
                   work on causality was not just a victory for common
                   sense, but a revolution in the study of the

  abstract =      {A (LONG OVERDUE) CAUSAL APPROACH TO INTRODUCTORY
                   EPIDEMIOLOGY Epidemiology is recognized as the
                   science of public health, evidence-based medicine,
                   and comparative effectiveness research. Causal
                   inference is the theoretical foundation underlying
                   all of the above. No introduction to epidemiology is
                   complete without extensive discussion of causal
                   inference; what's missing is a textbook that takes
                   such an approach. Epidemiology by Design takes a
                   causal approach to the foundations of traditional
                   introductory epidemiology. Through an organizing
                   principle of study designs, it teaches epidemiology
                   through modern causal inference approaches, including
                   potential outcomes, counterfactuals, and causal
                   identification conditions.Coverage in this textbook
                   includes:\dbend{} Introduction to measures of
                   prevalence and incidence (survival curves, risks,
                   rates, odds) and measures of contrast (differences,
                   ratios); the fundamentals of causal inference; and
                   principles of diagnostic testing, screening, and
                   surveillance\dbend{} Description of three key study
                   designs through the lens of causal inference:
                   randomized trials, prospective observational cohort
                   studies, and case-control studies\dbend{} Discussion
                   of internal validity (within a sample), external
                   validity, and population impact: the foundations of

                   scienceFor first-year graduate students and advanced
                   undergraduates in epidemiology and public health
                   fields more broadly, Epidemiology by Design offers a
                   rigorous foundation in epidemiologic methods and an
                   introduction to methods and thinking in causal
                   inference. This new textbook will serve as a
                   foundation not just for further study of the field,

                   when the underlying causal structure is unknown and
                   only limited knowledge is available. We assume all
                   covariates being considered are pretreatment
                   variables and that for each covariate it is known (i)
                   whether the covariate is a cause of treatment, and
                   (ii) whether the covariate is a cause of the outcome.
                   The causal relationships the covariates have with one
                   another is assumed unknown. We propose that control
                   be made for any covariate that is either a cause of
                   treatment or of the outcome or both. We show that
                   irrespective of the actual underlying causal
                   structure, if any subset of the observed covariates
                   suffices to control for confounding then the set of
                   covariates chosen by our criterion will also suffice.
                   We show that other, commonly used, criteria for
                   confounding control do not have this property. We use
                   formal theory concerning causal diagrams to prove our
                   result but the application of the result does not
                   rely on familiarity with causal diagrams. An
                   investigator simply need ask, ``Is the covariate a
                   cause of the treatment?'' and ``Is the covariate a
                   cause of the outcome?'' If the answer to either
                   question is ``yes'' then the covariate is included
                   for confounder control. We discuss some additional
                   covariate selection results that preserve
                   unconfoundedness and that may be of interest when
                   used with our criterion.},

                   in two distinct though related questions: 1) do we
                   have to adjust for birth weight when evaluating the
                   effect of prenatal risk factors on infant mortality?
                   and 2) is low birth weight a cause of infant
                   mortality?In our paper (2), we provided an answer to
                   the first question under several possible scenarios
                   represented by causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
                   (3). The most realistic of these scenarios, depicted
                   in parts 3.4 and 3.6 of our figure 3 (2), included an
                   effect of prenatal factors (i.e., maternal smoking)
                   on birth weight, as well as common causes of low
                   birth weight and infant mortality. The answer to
                   Wilcox's second question was assumed to be
                   affirmative in part 3.4 of the figure and negative in
                   part 3.6. In both cases, we concluded that adjustment
                   for birth weight was unnecessary to adjust for
                   confounding of the effect of prenatal factors on
                   mortality (there is no such confounding under our
                   DAGs) and that birth weight adjustment could
                   introduce selection bias (4).},

                   analysis within the causal-inference literature over
                   the last ten years. Much of this material appears in
                   a variety of specialized journals, and some of the
                   papers are quite technical. There has also been
                   considerable interest in these developments from
                   empirical researchers in the social and biomedical
                   sciences. However, much of the material is not
                   currently in a format that is accessible to them. The
                   book closes these gaps by providing an accessible,
                   comprehensive, book-length coverage of mediation. The
                   book begins with a comprehensive introduction to
                   mediation analysis, including chapters on concepts
                   for mediation, regression-based methods, sensitivity
                   analysis, time-to-event outcomes, methods for
                   multiple mediators, methods for time-varying
                   mediation and longitudinal data, and relations
                   between mediation and other concepts involving
                   intermediates such as surrogates, principal
                   stratification, instrumental variables, and Mendelian
                   randomization. The second part of the book concerns
                   interaction or "moderation," including concepts for
                   interaction, statistical interaction, confounding and
                   interaction, mechanistic interaction, bias analysis
                   for interaction, interaction in genetic studies, and
                   power and sample-size calculation for interaction.
                   The final part of the book provides comprehensive
                   discussion about the relationships between mediation
                   and interaction and unites these concepts within a
                   single framework. This final part also provides an
                   introduction to spillover effects or social
                   interaction, concluding with a discussion of
                   social-network analyses.The book is written to be
                   accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of
                   statistics. Comprehensive appendices provide more
                   technical details for the interested reader. Applied
                   empirical examples from a variety of fields are given
                   throughout. Software implementation in SAS, Stata,
                   SPSS, and R is provided. The book should be
                   accessible to students and researchers who have
                   completed a first-year graduate sequence in
                   quantitative methods in one of the social- or
                   biomedical-sciences disciplines. The book will only
                   presuppose familiarity with linear and logistic
                   regression, and could potentially be used as an
                   advanced undergraduate book as well.},

  abstract =      {In the daily news and the scientific literature, we
                   are faced with conflicting claims about the effects
                   caused by some treatments, behaviors, and policies. A
                   daily glass of wine prolongs life, or so we are told.
                   Yet we are also told that alcohol can cause
                   life-threatening cancer and that pregnant women
                   should abstain from drinking. Some say that raising
                   the minimum wage decreases inequality while others
                   say it increases unemployment. Investigators once
                   confidently claimed that hormone replacement therapy
                   reduces the risk of heart disease but today
                   investigators confidently claim it raises that risk.
                   How should we study such questions?Observation and
                   Experiment is an introduction to causal inference
                   from one of the field's leading scholars. Using
                   minimal mathematics and statistics, Paul Rosenbaum
                   explains key concepts and methods through scientific
                   examples that make complex ideas concrete and
                   abstract principles accessible.Some causal questions
                   can be studied in randomized trials in which coin
                   flips assign individuals to treatments. But because
                   randomized trials are not always practical or
                   ethical, many causal questions are investigated in
                   nonrandomized observational studies. To illustrate,
                   Rosenbaum draws examples from clinical medicine,
                   economics, public health, epidemiology, clinical
                   psychology, and psychiatry. Readers gain an
                   understanding of the design and interpretation of
                   randomized trials, the ways they differ from
                   observational studies, and the techniques used to
                   remove, investigate, and appraise bias in
                   observational studies. Observation and Experiment is
                   a valuable resource for anyone with a serious
                   interest in the empirical study of human health,
                   behavior, and well-being.},

                   ``paradoxes'' by well meaning statisticians, the one
                   reported by Frederic M. Lord in 1967 has earned a
                   special status. Although it can be viewed, formally,
                   as a version of Simpson's paradox, its reputation has
                   gone much worse. Unlike Simpson's reversal, Lord's is
                   easier to state, harder to disentangle and, for some
                   reason, it has been lingering for almost four
                   decades, under several interpretations and
                   re-interpretations, and it keeps coming up in new
                   situations and under new lights. Most peculiar yet,
                   while some of its variants have received a
                   satisfactory resolution, the original version
                   presented by Lord, to the best of my knowledge, has
                   not been given a proper treatment, not to mention a
                   resolution.},
