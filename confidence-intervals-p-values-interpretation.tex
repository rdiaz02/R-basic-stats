  \frametitle{Context is key}

 \begin{quoting}
    Dichotomous conclusions can be useful for pinning down discoveries of
    gene variants for osteoporosis, new bosons or carcinogens, say.

    \vspace*{15pt}
    But focusing on effect sizes can often be better than determining
    whether an effect exists.

  \item[Significance and hypothesis testing] Is there enough evidence to sent this
    person to jail? How likely is, if she were innocent, that she committed
    the crime?
    \vspace*{15pt}
    
  \item[Estimate] But I really think she is guilty. Or ``but the evidence is most
    compatible with her being guilty (though we cannot show it beyond reasonable
    doubt)''.

  \item A lot!!
  \item And what about wide CIs?
  \item Many studies seriously misinterpreted. It has happened a lot, with

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Many papers published with huge CI are papers with no information, basically
  \item But then, that leads to people believe that the drug is not effective
  \item That makes further additional studies unlikely or impossible because "we
    already know it does not work" (which is the wrong inference)
