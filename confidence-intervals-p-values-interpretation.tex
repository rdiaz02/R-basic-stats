  % [------------*--------------] : results compatible with very relevant effects
  %                                most definitely this provides NO support for the null

  %       			 can have wide CI, but the fact that it includes 0 does not mean "the
  %   drug does not work". No statistical significance just means "not enough
  %   information"



  %           [--*--]: the ideal thing



  % [-*-]  : like example below
  %   |
  %  [-*-] : all values are of little practical importance
  %          our results most compatible with no important effect
  %          (this ain't "the null is true"; it is "most likely little relevant")



  %                 |
  %   [-------------*-------------]
  %   Anything could be happening: from very relevant positive to very relevant
  %   negative. Probably little can be said here.


  %   | [-*-] : significant but not relevant

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Which one(s) will be significant (at 0.05)?
  \item Which are compatible with strong positive effects?
  \item Which ones make it sensible to try to focus on this gene as a possible
    target?

    \begin{itemize}
    \item what if chasing this lead is extremely expensive or risky (side effects?)?
    \item what if it is cheap?
    \end{itemize}
  \item Which one(s) make it sensible to forget about this gene as a possible
    target?
  \item We are using 95\%. What if we used 99\%? Or 90\%?

  \frametitle{Context is key}

 \begin{quoting}
    Dichotomous conclusions can be useful for pinning down discoveries of
    gene variants for osteoporosis, new bosons or carcinogens, say.

    \vspace*{15pt}
    But focusing on effect sizes can often be better than determining
    whether an effect exists.

  \frametitle{Taking someone to trial and presumption of innocence analogy}
  \begin{description}
  \item[Significance and hypothesis testing] Is there enough evidence to sent this person to jail? How likely is it, if she were innocent, that we find the corpse of the victim in her living room? What about her owning a pair of scissors? But \ldots: do you want \(P(O|H)\) or \(P(H|O)\)? (O: observations, H hypothesis)?
%    \vspace*{15pt}

  \item[Estimate] But I really think she is guilty. Or ``but the evidence is most compatible with her being guilty (though we cannot show it beyond reasonable doubt)''.

 %   \vspace*{15pt}
  \item[Bioquivalence] Sometimes like ``You have to show your innocence'' (if you want to dump chlorine in the river).

  \item What does the evidence say (how much evidence does this observation provide for/against the hypothesis)?
  \item What should I believe?
  \item How should I act?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Many papers published with huge CI are papers with no information, basically
  \item But then, that leads to people believe that the drug is not effective
  \item That makes further additional studies unlikely or impossible because "we
    already know it does not work" (which is the wrong inference)
